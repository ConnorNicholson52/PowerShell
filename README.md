Great Work Connor!  I feel your years of system administration has given you an understanding of what is useful to have in this repository.  I would recommend developing your readme more to explain the purpose of these tools.  I would also recommend adding possible scenarios when these tools would be useful.  The more professional you make this look the more confidents you will have adding the GitHub link to your resume.  Also, fork some other peoples repositories and make comments/edits.  You are welcome to look at my script and try to make them better.  I know I have learned something from you and I hope to return the favor
